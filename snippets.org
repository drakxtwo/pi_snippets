#+title: This is basically a dumping ground for various things i've found useful (emacs, mpd, raspberry & so on)
#+author: lee halls
#+date: 2017-02-14
#+startup: showeverything
#+options: toc:1

This for now covers all sorts in a relatively uncurated manner such things as turning the red light off on the pi camera, kiosk mode for Chrome and emacs tips. Plus in updating this for the new site i've learnt more about how ox-hugo functions [fn:0]

Everything here can be downloaded in the [[file:content-org/snippets.org][original org-mode]] format.

* Working with files
** read csv and create an array variable                          :@python:

So the following tries to open a csv file and store in the array ~SensorValues~ the contents of each row, if it fails to open the file it simply stores an arbitrary value

#+BEGIN_SRC python
# read in stored values & initialise preset values
import csv
try:
    with open('/tmp/tmpvalues.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
        fileRead = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
        for row in fileRead:
            SensorValues = [float(x) for x in row if x != '']
except:
    SensorValues = (
        66.00,
        66.00,
        66.00,
        66.00,
        66.00,
        66.00,
        66.00,
        66.00,
        66.00,
        66.00)
#+END_SRC

** credential file                                                :@python:
If you dont want to store your login details in a python script, for example if you want to share that script you dont want to give people you password do you? So you can create a file credentials file eg

~emacs -nw credentials.py~

Then type in the following;

#+BEGIN_SRC python
# email login details
em_login = {
    'smtpdata': 'smtp.server.address',
    'login': 'login.address',
    'password': 'login.password',
    'toemail': 'send.to.email.address'
}
# initial state details
in_login = {
    'login': 'login.address',
    'password': 'login.password',
    'accesskey': 'access.key',
    'bucketname': 'monitorhome',
    'bucketkey': 'bucket.key'
}
#+END_SRC

now call this file as a module in the main code and assign to your chosen variable

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import credentials

empassword = credentials.em_login['password']
inpassword = credentials.in_login['password']

print("email password:", empassword)
print("initial password:", inpassword)
#+END_SRC

** convert windows CR (carriage returns) to linux                   :linux:
~sed -i 's/\r//' filename~

Use with care it could destroy your file, it might be better to the dos2unix utility

* PiDisplay                                                     :raspberry:
Notes on using the offical pi touch screen
** rotate official display
Useful if the display case you've bought has a fixed orientation;

edit your ~/boot/config.txt~ file, and add the following line:

~lcd_rotate=2~
** onscreen keyboard
You can install an onscreen keyboard by;

~sudo apt-get install florence~

or 

~sudo apt-get install matchbox-keyboard~

then reboot, to access the keyboard click on menu/accessories/keyboard
** get backlight status
Weirdly (/at least i think so/) it's *0* for on and *1* for off and script must be run as root
#+BEGIN_SRC python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# gets current backlight state
file=open('/sys/devices/platform/rpi_backlight/backlight/rpi_backlight/bl_power','r+')
current_status=int(file.read(1))

print(current_status)
#+END_SRC

** kiosk mode
Kiosk mode runs your internet browser full screen useful for setting up a display system. Modify the */etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart* file or if using the NOOBS installation */etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart*
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
@lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
@xscreensaver -no-splash
@point-rpi

@xset s noblank
@xset s off
@xset -dpms

@chromium-browser --noerrdialogs --kiosk http://127.0.0.1:5000 --incognito --disable-translate
#+END_SRC

*BE AWARE* if the following file exists then it overrides any other files so the @chromium command must go in here.

~nano .config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart~

so edit it to show the line;

~@chromium-browser --noerrdialogs --kiosk http://127.0.0.1:5000 --incognito --disable-translate~

so my file reads;

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
@lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
@xscreensaver -no-splash
@point-rpi
@chromium-browser --noerrdialogs --kiosk http://127.0.0.1:5000 --incognito --disable-translate
#+END_SRC

* Audio
** Enabling Audio Output                                        :raspberry:
By default, the RPi audio output is set to automatically select the digital HDMI interface if its being used, otherwise the analog audio output. You can force it to use a specific interface via the sound mixer controls.  amixer allows command-line control of the mixer for the ALSA driver.

You can force the RPi to use a specific interface using the command amixer cset numid=3 N where the N parameter means the following:

 - 0=auto
 - 1=analog
 - 2=hdmi

Therefore, to force the Raspberry Pi to use the analog output:

~amixer cset numid=3 1~

** How to play Internet radio on your Raspberry PI (mpd/mpc)    :raspberry:

first make sure your audio is working, using the ALSA package

install the mpd and mpc packages:

~sudo apt-get install mpd mpc~

change the permissions of mpd (just to make sure):

~sudo service mpd stop~
~sudo chmod -R g+w /var/lib/mpd~
~sudo chmod -R g+w /var/run/mpd~

make a change to the mpd config file /etc/mpd.conf

~sudo nano /etc/mpd.conf~

Note all the sites i visited suggested that it was simply commenting OUT the line:

~bind_to_address "localhost"~

however i had many issues and nothing seemed to work until i had the conf file set as follows;

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# bind_to_address "localhost"
bind_to_address "127.0.0.1"
port "6600"
#+END_SRC

shutdown/reboot your Raspberry PI after it's up and running again add an Internet radio URL, for instance:

 - ~mpc add http://icecast.omroep.nl/3fm-bb-mp3~

to start playing the stream type:

 - ~mpc play~

The other thing to be aware of is you may need to download the radio stations m3u playlist file and open it to extract the direct URL of the stream (/i had to/) so the stream i needed was;

    ~http://stream4.nadaje.com:11986/prs~

then save that into MY OWN m3u playlist for for the MPD daemon to work.

** python check if mpc is playing                       :@python:raspberry:

#+NAME:check if mpc is running with python
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from mpd import MPDClient

client=MPDClient()
client.idletimeout = None          # timeout for fetching the result of the idle command is handled seperately, default: None
client.connect("localhost", 6600)  # connect to localhost:6600
print(client.mpd_version)

if client.status()['state'] in ('play', 'pause'):
    print('Playing')
else:
    print('stopped')

#+END_SRC

* bash
** alias                                                            :linux:
for example if you get tired of typing emacs -nw to start emacs without a gui window then add

~alias enw='emacs -nw'~

to the end of your .profile or .bashrc file located at /home or /home/usr

* misc
** Display system's serial support                        :linux:raspberry:

** nginx gpg key                                                :raspberry:
The distributed version of nginx is old, if you want to install the newer versions you have to self compile but first you need to take a couple of steps;

create a file;

 - ~sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx.list~

and add the line;

~deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/debian/ wheezy nginx~


then run apt-get update and you will receive an error stating the signatures cannot be verified, to overcome this you need the nginx keys which you can get via;

~curl -O https://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key && apt-key add ./nginx_signing.key~

now run
~sudo apt-key update~
~sudo apt-get update~

and you should get no error messages meaning you can now run;

~apt-get source nginx~

to finally get the latest nginx source for building on your pi (/set aside quite some time for it to build/) and to install use

~sudo dpkg -i nginx_1.9.4-1~squeeze_armhf.deb~

** MOTD                                                   :linux:raspberry:

Below MOTD was found somewhere on the net, when i find from where i'll add a link (its only here in this file so i remember)

To get something like this every time you log in;

[[file+sys:imgs_pisnippets/2017-11-11 10_34_24-192.168.0.69 (pi).png]]

using mariadb as the main sql server

logon to sql server: ~mysql -u root -p~

~CREATE TABLE temps (recnum int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, recdate DATE DEFAULT NULL, rectime time DEFAULT NULL, external float DEFAULT NULL, frontroom float DEFAULT NULL, bedroom float DEFAULT NULL, kitchen float DEFAULT NULL,PRIMARY KEY( recnum ));~

now we can see what we've created with;

~show columns in temps~

now to leave the sql server simply type ~exit;~

** access serial port                                           :raspberry:
when you want python to access the serial port it will if not run as root error out with permission denied. To get round this add your user to the dialout group eg

~sudo adduser <username> dialout~

then logout and log back in, you should now be able to run your python script with using root. To check what groups your user is a member of simply type ~groups~
* crontab
** run in background during boot                          :linux:raspberry:
The & at the end of the line makes the script run in the background whilst the pi carries on booting
@reboot sudo python /home/pi/homeApp/ourhome.py &
** enable cron logging                                    :linux:raspberry:
By default, the logging for the cron daemon is not enabled in Debian To enable it, open the file /etc/rsyslog.conf via

~sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf~

and uncomment the line

~cron.*                          /var/log/cron.log~
** run on reboot                                          :linux:raspberry:
to run a command on boot i use the following in the crontab file

~@reboot your_run_command~

** cron sleep                                             :linux:raspberry:
Starting a command on reboot after x seconds

For some reason my pi would not wait for the wifi network to come online (wait for network on boot is enabled) so my NAS wont connect, to be honest i had other things to do than fault find so as i added an @reboot mount command with a sleep period to ensure the drive was accessible;

~@reboot sleep 10;sudo mount -a~

* network
** setup new blank image
before removing the flashed sd card

create a blank file called ssh

then create a file called wpa_supplicant.conf with the following;

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=gb

network={
    ssid="your_SSID"
    psk="your_password"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
** setup wifi via command line

~sudo iwlist wlan0 scan~

Open the wpa-supplicant configuration file in nano:
~sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf~
Go to the bottom of the file and add the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
country=gb
update_config=1
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

network={
    scan_ssid=1
    ssid="testing"
    psk="testingPassword"
}
#+END_SRC

Then re-configure the interface by ~wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure~

** Static or fixed IP address
add to /etc/dhcpcd.conf
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#Custom static IP address
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.04/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1
#+END_SRC

changing eth0 to wlan0 depending on connection type and also remember to use your own choice of IP address/subnet etc

** mail

Had problems with a cron job and no idea why & at the time had not setup [[*enable cron logging][logging]] and without an MTA [Mail Transport Assistant] i could not see what errors were being given, after reading up i installed postfix

~sudo apt install postfix~

Choosing "LOCAL" during setup, then after a reboot i could use the following to find out what went wrong:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo tail -f /var/mail/<user>
#+END_SRC

alternatively you can set up a more capable system and allow your Pi to send mail using your google account

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt-get install ssmtp mailutils mpack
sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

** sshfs - access the file system                                :raspberry:
One trick i didnt learn until far too late was *sshfs* essentially it mounts your remote system as a folder on your dekstop so instead of saving files then transfering etc you can open and load the remote files and work on them as if local. Excellent for tweaking your python website.

Assuming you have sshfs installed then the line of code you need is really simple;

~sshfs pi@192.168.1.69:/home/pi home/user/folder/~

** python ping                                                     :@python:
Little code that could be used as heartbeat for a remote headless device

First ~sudo pip install ping~

#+BEGIN_SRC python

* emacs                                                    :@emacs:orgmode:
** emacs commands/tips
*** comment out sections of code

when a region is highlighted pressing ~M-;~ will comment out the section so much easier than moving line by line

*** a timer - this one i really like
Pressing ~C-c C-x -~ starts a list in emacs with timer, now pressing M-RET will allow notes 

 #+begin_example
 - 0:00:00 :: Now I can start taking some notes.        
 - 0:00:02 :: If I hit ~M-RET~, a new list item is created.
 - 0:00:06 :: And so on 
 #+end_example

As emacs is always open and i often do cycle time analysis i find this a nice easy way of timing and making notes instead of sitting with the phone in hand hoping no one calls.

*** org-toggle-link-display
OK not a shortcut but really useful for me once toggled it displays links in their unshortened form which means if a link has a ~%20~ in it then the emacs search & replace ~M-shift-%~ will work (/for some reason files i've transferred from machine to machine all had link spaces replaced with ~%20~ so this function became very useful

*** occurrence of text
Quite useful pressing ~M-x~ and then typing ~occur~  brings up a search function 

[[file:/img/mx_occur.png]]

which then searches your file with regexp & opens a second buffer with all matches

*** emacs org-publish
/kept here just for future reference/ took me a long time to get this working for a lot of reasons, once configured don't use ~ctrl c-e P~ to get to publish going you using the below example use ~alt-x org-publish ret org ret~

* Footnotes
[fn:0] a single page is the /preferred/ ox-hugo way and now i understand why. Every header in the above file has tags which makes pulling all relevant info together easy as shown by the posts section but in a single file these tags and categories per heading are *irrelevant/ignored* when published via ox-hugo. It is the document level tags defined in the header of the file by ~#+HUGO_TAGS: linux raspberry orgmode~ that are used. So that when you click on for example ~orgmode~ in your site tag list it will not pull up the individual entries from this page with the tag orgmode but this whole document will be shown eg [[file:/img/oxhugo_onefile.jpg]] so i've removed the document level tags as i feel its not "/nice/" and you can still download the orgfile itself anyway.
