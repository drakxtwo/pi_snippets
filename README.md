# Pi Snippets #

Bits and pieces of code or information that i've found useful in setting up and working with the [RaspberryPi] (https://www.raspberrypi.org/) also code examples that i've either created or found for use in projects.

Areas covered include bash, python, general info such GPIO, audiio etc.

Very much **work in progress**
